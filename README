How's it useful?

Web application developers sometimes fail to add safe checks against
authentications, file inclusion ..etc are prone
to reveal possible sensitive information when
those applications' URLs are directly requested.
	 Sometimes, it's a clue to Local File Inclusion vulnerability.
For open-source applications, source code can be downloaded and 
checked to find such information. 

This script will do this job.
First you have to download source archived file of your desired OSS.
Second, extract it.
Third, feed its path to inspath

The inspath takes
-d argument as source directory (of application)
-u arguement as the target base URL (like http://victim.com)
-t argument as the number of threads concurrently to run (default is 10)
-l argument as the language [php,asp,aspx,jsp,jspx,all] (default is all)
-x argument as the extension (default regex: php4,php5,asp,aspx

It should work well on both Linux and Windows systems.
