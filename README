How's it useful?

Web application developers sometimes fail to add safe checks against authentications, file inclusion ..etc are prone
to reveal possible sensitive information when those applications' URLs are directly requested. 
Sometimes, it's a clue to Local File Inclusion vulnerability. 
For open-source applications, source code can be downloaded and checked to find such information. 

This script will do this job.
First you have to download source archived file of your desired OSS.
Second, extract it.
Third, feed its path to inspathx.

The inspath takes
-d argument as source directory (of application)
-u arguement as the target base URL (like http://victim.com)
-t argument as the number of threads concurrently to run (default is 10)
-l argument as your desired language [php,asp,aspx,jsp,all] (default is all)
-x argument as your desired extensions separated with | character (default : php4|php5|php6|php|asp|aspx|jsp|jspx) - make sure to enclose multiple extensions with double quotes - See Examples

It should work well on both Linux and Windows systems.


Examples

ruby inspathx.rb -d /sources/phpmyadmin -u http://localhost/phpmyadmin -t 20

ruby inspathx.rb -d c:/sources/phpmyadmin -u http://localhost/phpmyadmin -t 20

ruby inspathx.rb -d /sources/dotnetnuke -u http://localhost/dotnetnuke -t 20 -l aspx

ruby inspathx.rb -d /sources/jspnuke -u http://localhost/jspnuke -t 20 -l jsp -x "jsp|jspx"
